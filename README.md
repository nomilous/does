### todo / dev challenges

* mode 'spec', (to allow more systemic modes later)
* wanr on setting expectation on non-existant function
* create active mock / spy - replaces original
* restoring original functions after
* knowing when test ended
    * 2 seconds default is easy (ish)
    * mocha's `this.timeout(NNN)` more tricky to deal with
